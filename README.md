# Smart-Traffic-System
This project is a prototype of a smart traffic management system developed in Python, aimed at optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion. Using real-time data from sensors and cameras, the system dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on current traffic conditions to improve vehicle movement and minimize delays. The prototype demonstrates the core functionality of intelligent traffic control, utilizing Python libraries for data processing, IoT integration, and decision-making algorithms. This system has the potential to enhance road safety, reduce waiting times, and contribute to a more efficient and sustainable transportation network.

SUMO for Simulation:

We use SUMO (Simulator for Urban MObility) software to simulate the traffic lights in real time.
SUMO is employed for simulation purposes, providing a realistic environment to test and optimize traffic signal strategies in our model.

soon updating examples of some of the maps used to train the model.
